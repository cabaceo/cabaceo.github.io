Hi, my name is Guangming, and I'm the chief data scientist and principal consultant at Cabaceo LLC. I started Cabaceo in Ann Arbor, Michigan back in 2013. Since then, I've helped more than 63 companies and individuals solve their mission critical analytic problems. My goal has always been building strong and long term working relationships, and many of my clients come back to work with me over the years. I'm very grateful for that.

Before Cabaceo, I worked as an analytic consultant at FICO, where I built scorecards and customer segmentations. I have an undergraduate degree in math from the New College of Florida and a master's degree in biostatistics from the University of Michigan. During my graduate studies at Michigan, I won the prestigious national science foundation graduate research fellowship award.

I've programmed in R for 7 years, and I enjoy teaching people how to use R to do data science and machine learning. So I started [MasterR.org](http://masterr.org), an online community where you can get high quality training materials for FREE.

One client calls me "the most creative data scientist he's ever worked with." I think that might have something to do with my experiences in the non-data fields. For example, I danced the Argentine Tango for 6 years. And I swim, row (on a machine), read, and play the ukulele regularly if not every day.

I currently have one backend developer and two PhD level data scientists working with me part time. Their expertise and industry experiences provide great value add-on to our clients.

Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day!
