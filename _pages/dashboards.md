We use R shiny and python to build web-based dashboards for clients from marketing, law, fintech and retail industries. In 2018, we built a full-fledged web app for a client in the used car loans business to improve their underwriting process and accuracy. The web app takes data entries from multiple users and stores them in a database. It then scores the data with a machine learning model that we trained and backtested with historical data, and displays the recommended decision along with graphs of the decision factors. Check out the following demo collection that we built for fun.
