I"µ	<p>Hi, welcome to our site. My name is Guangming. Iâ€™m the founder and chief data scientist of Cabaceo LLC, which I started in Ann Arbor, Michigan back in 2013 after graduate school. Since day one, my goal has always been building strong and long lasting relationships with clients. Because we deliver excellence and delight clients with high ROIs, many clients have been with us over the years. Iâ€™m very grateful for that.</p>

<p>I used to worked as an analytic consultant at FICO, where I built models to predict marketing campaign responses and ran customer segmentations for companies like Coca-Cola, The Picture People, Dickâ€™s Sporting Goods, and Canadian Tire Bank. I have an undergraduate degree in math from the New College of Florida and a masterâ€™s degree in biostatistics from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. During my graduate studies, I was awarded the prestigious National Science Foundation graduate research fellowship. My circle of competence includes data science, machine learning, statistics, R and Python programming, mathematics, and finance. My tech stack includes R + Rstudio, Python 3 + IPython + VSCode + PyCharm + Colab, XGBoost, Keras, and TensorFlow.</p>

<p>We have cleaned, visualized, explored, and analyzed data from various industries, including crypto and DeFi, stock market, fintech, finance, real estate, eCommerce, SaaS, general services (e.g., car wash, food delivery), survey, psychometrics, media, marketing, sales, human resouces, medicine, heathcare, and biotech. We have also built production-level machine learning engines with the following algorithms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis,</li>
  <li>clustering algorithms such as hierarchical and k-means clustering,</li>
  <li>supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, poisson regression, ridge regression, LASSO, survival models, linear mixed models, linear panel models,  support vector machine, gradient boosting, Bayesian methods and deep neural nets (deep learning).</li>
</ul>

<p>We pride ourselves in value creation through creativity and effective communication. When you work with us, we will strive to create value for you from day one, and provide you with on-call support seven days a week.
