I"<p>The client, a multifamily real estate investor, contracted us to create a data-driven analytical system that scores certain geographic areas to show what areas have the highest investment potential for multifamily properties (apartment buildings).</p>

<p>The algorithm would measure population density and growth, income growth, job growth, housing values/growth, rental values/growth, crime rate, amongst other key metrics. The algorithm would assign a score to each geographic area with the highest scores being the most optimal.</p>
