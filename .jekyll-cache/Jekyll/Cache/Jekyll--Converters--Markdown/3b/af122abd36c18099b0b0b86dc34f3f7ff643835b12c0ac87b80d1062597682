I"g<p>A research lab from a well-known American University contracted us to analyze data from a pilot study they conducted on 77 mice of 2 genotypes and 3 age groups. The data included various cellular measurements between 1 and 5 cells per mouse. The first goal was to test for any differences in those cellular measurements between genotypes within an age group, and between any two age groups within a genotype. The second goal was to establish a relationship between power and sample size for detecting a certain significant difference in some of the cellular measurements while controlling a 5% type I error.</p>
