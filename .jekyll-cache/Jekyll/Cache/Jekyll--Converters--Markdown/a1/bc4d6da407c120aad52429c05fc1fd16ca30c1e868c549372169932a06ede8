I"£<p>This is one of our research/passion projects. If a stock price series is
mean-reverting, we can trade on it and make a profit if we can accurately
estimate its mean and the standard deviation for the near future. Kalman filter is
an excellent technique for doing that. To learn how Kalman filter works its magic, 
you can read our paper <a href="/assets/stock-price-forecasting-with-kalman-filter.pdf">here</a>.</p>
