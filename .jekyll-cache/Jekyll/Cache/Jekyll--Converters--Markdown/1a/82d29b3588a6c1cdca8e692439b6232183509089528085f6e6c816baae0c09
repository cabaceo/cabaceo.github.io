I"Œ<p>The client, Retina Consultants of Houston, contracted us to analyze a dataset of 40 patients from a prospective clinical trial. Data were collected weekly on three treatment groups over 2 years. The primary goal was to test if there were any differences in several clinical measurements among the treatment groups between weeks 0, 24 and 48.</p>

<p>We performed data cleaning (e.g., replacing missing values with the last non-missing observation for each patient). We made box and line plots to show differences within and between treatment groups over time. We ran 1-way repeated measure ANOVA with post hoc pairwise comparison, linear mixed models with multiple comparison, pairwise t-test, and chi-squared test respectively to test the differences in various clinical measurements between the treatment groups. We interpreted the statistical results and wrote detailed explanation of the methods.</p>
