I"Q<p>The client, Vivace Health Solutions, hired us to build machine learning models to predict the onset of sepsis and septic shock for adult and pediatric patients.</p>

<p>Using MIMIC-II and MIMIC-III ICU data, we trained and cross-validated the following machine learning models:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Linear regression for modeling time trends,</li>
  <li>Logistic regression model with LASSO regularization,</li>
  <li>Linear discriminant analysis (LDA),</li>
  <li>Support vector machine (SVM) with radial kernel, and</li>
  <li>Cox proportional hazards model with LASSO regularization and time-varying covariates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our models demonstrated success at predicting septic event onset 72 hours in advance. Our models were integrated into the clientâ€™s clinical decision support technology platform for use in an acute care environment.</p>
