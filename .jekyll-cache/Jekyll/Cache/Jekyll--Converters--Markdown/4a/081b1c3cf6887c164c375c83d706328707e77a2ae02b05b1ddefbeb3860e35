  <p>Guangming did a fantastic job with our request. We gave him a complex set of data that lacked any sort of standard structure and he was able to standardize our data set, create a compelling analysis, and meet all of our changing needs. He was very communicative during the problem solving and evaluation process, would definitely hire him again!</p>

<p>The client, a marketing operations manager from Ingersoll Rand, approached us for data-driven insights that would help with re-structuring their digital marketing team.</p>

<p>The client gave us excel files with multiple tabs on each file and complex relationships amongst the fields. We merged the files into one master dataset and derived new features. We identified periods when data were partially missing whereas the client thought the data were there. We made tables of summary statistics, bar charts, and heat maps to show the distributions of the hours, cost, headcount, and other metrics for each brand and each role in 2018 and 2019. By analyzing historical time cards, We were able to create a visual story that outlined the roles, durations, and headcount involved for completing various projects. Finally, we used statistical methods to estimate the headcount and hours needed for X number of projects, as well as the number of full-timers needed for each role.</p>
