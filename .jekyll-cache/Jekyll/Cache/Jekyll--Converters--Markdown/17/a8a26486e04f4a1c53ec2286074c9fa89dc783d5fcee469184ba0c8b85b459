I"š<p>The client, a real estate investment company, contracted us to analyze the performance of their asset portfolios and compare with their projected numbers.</p>

<p>We generated descriptive statistics and charts and conducted paired t-tests for over 25 metrics that the client was tracking. Our analysis identified rules of thumb for the client. An example rule of thumb reads like this: â€œon average, for wrap developments in suburban, the markets have X number of units, the cost/unit to build is Y, and it takes Z months to complete, and achieves W rent/sqft.â€ These rules of thumb allowed the client to make better and quicker decisions on future deals.</p>
