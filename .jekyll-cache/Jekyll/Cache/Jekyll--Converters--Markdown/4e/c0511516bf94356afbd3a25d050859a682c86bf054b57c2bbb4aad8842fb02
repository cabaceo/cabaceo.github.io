<blockquote>
  <p>I enjoyed working with Guangming and his colleague. They were impressive from the proposal to final product submittal. Easy to communicate with on email, Slack, and Upwork. If you are doing any analytics with machine vision or space coordinate tracking, they will be valuable to your team. They wanted to know details on what questions I was trying to answer and then they worked their data science magic to find solutions. Nice work. Will work with them again when the right project comes along. - Tim Swieter, Steelcase Inc.</p>
