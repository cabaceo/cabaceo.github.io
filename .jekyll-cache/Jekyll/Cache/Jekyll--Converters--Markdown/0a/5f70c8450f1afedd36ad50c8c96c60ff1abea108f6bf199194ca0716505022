I"Œ<p>The client, a financial planning company, hired us to build a tool for projecting the spending down of a portfolio during post-divorce. For example, a 40 year old woman gets divorced and gets $1 million, which she invests in a portfolio of stocks and bonds. She needs a monthly living expense of $5000 for the first ten years, and $4000 for the rest of her life. She will get monthly child support of $600 for 10 years, and monthly alimony of $400 for 4 years. She will start receiving $1500 per month in Social Security in 27 years. How long will her portfolio last? How much income can she withdraw without spending the portfolio down at all?</p>
