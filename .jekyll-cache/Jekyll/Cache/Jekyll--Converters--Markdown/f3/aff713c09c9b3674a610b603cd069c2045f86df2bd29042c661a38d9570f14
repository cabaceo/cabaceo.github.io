I"%<p>The client, Bioproximity, asked us to analyze their “Omics” data in R using Bioconductor packages (clusterProfiler, RITAN, and MS-EmpiRe).</p>

<p>We leared how to use these packages by following their vignettes, documentations and sometimes source code.</p>

<p>We analyzed the client’s data, leveraging these packages. If a package turned out to be not useful, we researched another and repeated until we solved the problem.</p>

<p>We worked with the client’s engineering team to integrate our scripts into their service platform.</p>
