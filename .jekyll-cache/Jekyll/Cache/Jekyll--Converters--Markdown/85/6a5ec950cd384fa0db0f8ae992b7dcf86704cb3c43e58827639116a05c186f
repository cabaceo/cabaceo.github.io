  <p>Guangming did a fantastic job with our request. We gave him a complex set of data that lacked any sort of standard structure and he was able to standardize our data set, create a compelling analysis, and meet all of our changing needs. He was very communicative during the problem solving and evaluation process, would definitely hire him again!</p>

<p>The client, a marketing operations manager from Ingersoll Rand, approached us for data-driven insights that would help with re-structuring their digital marketing team.</p>

<p>Although the data were messy, we were able to clean them and identify periods where the data were partially missing but the client thought were there.</p>

<p>We created summary statistics, bar charts, and heat maps to show the distributions of hours, cost, headcount, and other metrics for each brand and role in 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p>Using statistical methods, we estimated the headcount and hours needed for X number of projects, as well as the number of full-timers needed for each role.</p>

<p>By analyzing historical time cards, We were able to create a visual story that outlined the roles, durations, and headcount involved for completing various projects.</p>
