I"]<p>The client, Retina Consultants of Houston, contracted us to analyze a dataset of 40 patients from a prospective clinical trial. Data were collected weekly on three treatment groups over 2 years. The primary goal was to test if there were any differences in several clinical measurements among the treatment groups between weeks 0, 24 and 48.</p>
