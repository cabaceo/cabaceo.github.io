I"u<p>The client, a real estate investment company, contracted us to analyze the performance of their asset portfolios and compare with their projected numbers.</p>

<p>We generated summary statistics, plotted statistical charts, and conducted paired t-tests for over 25 metrics.</p>

<p>Our analysis identified rules of thumb for the client (e.g., on average, for wrap developments in suburban, markets have X number of units, the cost/unit to build is Y, and it take Z months to complete, and achieves W rents/sqft of USD, etcâ€¦). These rules of thumb allowed the client to make better and quicker decisions on future deals.</p>
