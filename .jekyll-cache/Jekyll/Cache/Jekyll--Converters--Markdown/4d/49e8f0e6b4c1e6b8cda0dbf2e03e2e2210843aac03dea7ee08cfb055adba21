I"M<p>The client, Precision for Medicine, contracted us to help develop a R pipeline for processing flow cytometry data. We were given a well-defined list of tasks that we successfully accomplished:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review data and pipeline requirements,</li>
  <li>create implementation plan for pipeline,</li>
  <li>implement pipeline in publicly available data following general guidelines from opencyto.org,</li>
  <li>implement gating pipeline for HVTN080,</li>
  <li>perform autogating of raw FCS files with OpenCyto,</li>
  <li>output gated data from autogating pipeline,</li>
  <li>visualize gated data using OpenCyto functions and write wrapper functions to allow for more flexibility in plotting options,</li>
  <li>output patient-level data by biomarker for downstream processing, and</li>
  <li>document implementation steps.</li>
</ul>
