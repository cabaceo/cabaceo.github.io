I"8<p>The client, a real estate investment company, asked us to analyze their portfolio performance and compare with the projected numbers.</p>

<p>We created descriptive statistics and charts and conducted paired t-tests for over 25 metrics. Our analysis revealed rules of thumb, for example, “On average, for wrap developments in suburban, the markets have X number of units, the cost/unit to build is Y, and it takes Z months to complete, and achieves W rent/sqft.” These rules of thumb allowed the client to make better and quicker decisions on future deals.</p>
