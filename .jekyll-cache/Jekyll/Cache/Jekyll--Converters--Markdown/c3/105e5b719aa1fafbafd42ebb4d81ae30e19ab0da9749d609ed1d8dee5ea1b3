I"-<p>The client, Bioproximity LLC, contracted us to analyze their “Omics” data with R Bioconductor packages (clusterProfiler, RITAN, and MS-EmpiRe).</p>

<p>The workflow for this project involved four steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The client described their problem and pointed us to a Bioconductor package that might be useful to provide a solution.</li>
  <li>We studied the package by working through its vignettes and reading the documentations and sometimes source code.</li>
  <li>We wrote R code to analyze the client’s data, using functions from the package. If the package turned out to be unhelpful, we researched another one and repeated step 2 until we solved the problem.</li>
  <li>We worked with the engineers on the client’s team to integrate our scripts into their production codebase.</li>
</ol>
