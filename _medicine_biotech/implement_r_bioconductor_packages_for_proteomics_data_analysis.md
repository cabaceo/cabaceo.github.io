title: "Implement R Bioconductor Packages for Proteomics Data Analysis"
---

The client, Bioproximity, asked us to analyze their "Omics" data in R using Bioconductor packages (clusterProfiler, RITAN, and MS-EmpiRe).

We leared how to use these packages by following their vignettes, documentations and sometimes source code.

We analyzed the clientâ€™s data, leveraging these packages. If a package turned out to be not useful, we researched another and repeated until we solved the problem.

We worked with the client's engineering team to integrate our scripts into their service platform.
