title: "Develop Pipeline for Processing Flow Cytometry Data"
---

The client, Precision for Medicine, contracted us to help develop a R pipeline for processing flow cytometry data. We were given a well-defined list of tasks that we successfully accomplished:

- review data and pipeline requirements,
- create implementation plan for pipeline,
- implement pipeline in publicly available data following general guidelines from opencyto.org,
- implement gating pipeline for HVTN080,
- perform autogating of raw FCS files with OpenCyto,
- output gated data from autogating pipeline,
- visualize gated data using OpenCyto functions and write wrapper functions to allow for more flexibility in plotting options,
- output patient-level data by biomarker for downstream processing, and
- document implementation steps.
