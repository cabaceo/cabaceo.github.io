title: "Analyze Marketing Operations Data"

>Guangming did a fantastic job with our request. We gave him a complex set of data that lacked any sort of standard structure and he was able to standardize our data set, create a compelling analysis, and meet all of our changing needs. He was very communicative during the problem solving and evaluation process, would definitely hire him again!

The client, a marketing operations manager from Ingersoll Rand, approached us for data-driven insights that would help with re-structuring their digital marketing team.

Although the data were messy, we successfully cleaned them and identified periods where data were partially missing but the client thought were there.

We created summary statistics, bar charts, and heat maps to show the distributions of hours, cost, headcount, and other metrics for each brand and each role in 2018 and 2019. By analyzing historical time cards, We were able to create a visual story that delineated the roles, durations, and headcount involved for completing various projects.

Using statistical methods, we estimated the headcount and hours needed for X number of projects, as well as the number of full-timers needed for each role.
This allowed the client to confidently plan and organize their team for 2020 and 2021.
