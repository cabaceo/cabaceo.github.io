title: "Improve and Maintain HR Analytics Codebase"
---

The client, Hire Smarter, Inc., contracted us to adopt and maintain a complex set of R scripts and libraries for two of their customer companies.

We fixed bugs and improved the data pulling and sanitation scripts. We ran different analyses to report the evolution of headcount and attrition, the dynamics of job paths, attrition cost, KPI patterns, and employee tenure. We refactored, rewrote, and simplified the codebase. We improved pipeline automation and documentation.
