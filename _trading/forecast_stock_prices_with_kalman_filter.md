title: "Kalman Filter & the Mean-Reverting Strategy"
---

If a stock price series is mean-reverting, we can trade on it and make a profit
if we can accurately estimate its mean and the standard deviation for the near
future. Kalman filter is an excellent technique for doing that. Read our

how Kalman filter works its magic.
